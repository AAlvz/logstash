logstash tests.

Readme file will improve in the future.

This is an introduction to ELK.

To process logs run:

`logstash-1.4.2/bin/logstash -f logstash.conf`

Make sure:

  - The log files are in the appropiate folder (I normally use /tmp)
  - The Nginx file is set properly on sites-available
  - Run ElasticS -> Logstash -> Kibana
